The pipeline:
- Ingests raw data from an **HTTP source**
- Processes data using **Apache Spark in Azure Databricks**
- Serves analytics-ready data via **Azure Synapse Serverless SQL**
- Visualizes insights using **Power BI**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The solution follows a **layered architecture** to ensure **data quality, scalability, and performance**.


### High-Level Flow
- **Data ingestion** from an HTTP source using **Azure Data Factory**
- **Raw data storage** in **ADLS Gen2 (Bronze layer)**
- **Data transformation** using **Databricks**, written in **Parquet format (Silver layer)**
- **Analytics-ready data exposure** via **Synapse Serverless SQL (Gold layer)**
- **Reporting and visualization** through **Power BI**

## ⚙️ Step 1: Azure Environment Setup

The following Azure resources were provisioned to support the end-to-end data pipeline:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Used for data ingestion, orchestration, and automation  
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:** Acts as the centralized data lake, storing **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** data layers  
- **Azure Databricks:** Performs scalable data transformations using **Apache Spark**  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL):** Enables analytics and BI querying without dedicated infrastructure  

All services were configured with appropriate **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles and permissions to ensure:
- Secure service-to-service communication  
- Seamless data access across Azure components  
- Adherence to best practices for cloud security
